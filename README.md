# Gateway Home Assistant Integration

This repository is part of the [LoRaBridge](https://github.com/lorabridge/lorabridge) project.
It provides the docker image for the Home Assistant integration software used on our gateway device.

The HA Integration is a self-provided Python3 application. 
It translates the MQTT messages sent by the Device Manager into messages understood by the MQTT integration of Home Assistant.
